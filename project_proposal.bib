	abstract = {Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of myeloid-lineage cells with limited therapeutic options. We previously combined ex vivo drug sensitivity with genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical annotations for a large cohort of AML patients, which facilitated discovery of functional genomic correlates. Here, we present a dataset that has been harmonized with our initial report to yield a cumulative cohort of 805 patients (942 specimens). We show strong cross-cohort concordance and identify features of drug response. Further, deconvoluting transcriptomic data shows that drug sensitivity is governed broadly by AML cell differentiation state, sometimes conditionally affecting other correlates of response. Finally, modeling of clinical outcome reveals a single gene, PEAR1, to be among the strongest predictors of patient survival, especially for young patients. Collectively, this report expands a large functional genomic resource, offers avenues for mechanistic exploration and drug development, and reveals tools for predicting outcome in AML.},

	abstract = {Previous epidemiologic studies on AML have been limited by the rarity of the disease. Here, we present population level data on survival of patients with AML in Germany and the United States (US). Data were extracted from 11 population-based cancer registries in Germany and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER13) database in the US. Patients diagnosed with AML in 1997–2011 were included. Period analysis was used to estimate 5-year relative survival (RS) and trends in survival in the early 21st century. Overall 5-year age-adjusted RS for patients with AML in 2007–2011 was greater in Germany than in the US at 22.8\% and 18.8\%, respectively. Five-year RS was higher in Germany than in the US at all ages, with particularly large differences at ages 15–24 for whom 5-year RS was 64.3\% in Germany and 55.0\% in the US and 35–44, with 5-year RS estimates of 61.8\% in Germany and 46.6\% in the US. Most of the difference in 5-year RS was due to higher 1-year RS, with overall 1-year RS estimates of 47.0\% in Germany and 38.5\% in the US. A small increase in RS was observed between 2003–2005 and 2009–2011 in both countries, but no increase in survival was observed in either country for ages 75+. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed description of AML survival in Germany. Comparison to the US suggests that further analysis into risk factors for poor outcomes in AML in the US may be useful in improving survival.},

	abstract = {Evaluating binary classifications is a pivotal task in statistics and machine learning, because it can influence decisions in multiple areas, including for example prognosis or therapies of patients in critical conditions. The scientific community has not agreed on a general-purpose statistical indicator for evaluating two-class confusion matrices (having true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives) yet, even if advantages of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) over accuracy and F1 score have already been shown.In this manuscript, we reaffirm that MCC is a robust metric that summarizes the classifier performance in a single value, if positive and negative cases are of equal importance. We compare MCC to other metrics which value positive and negative cases equally: balanced accuracy (BA), bookmaker informedness (BM), and markedness (MK). We explain the mathematical relationships between MCC and these indicators, then show some use cases and a bioinformatics scenario where these metrics disagree and where MCC generates a more informative response.Additionally, we describe three exceptions where BM can be more appropriate: analyzing classifications where dataset prevalence is unrepresentative, comparing classifiers on different datasets, and assessing the random guessing level of a classifier. Except in these cases, we believe that MCC is the most informative among the single metrics discussed, and suggest it as standard measure for scientists of all fields. A Matthews correlation coefficient close to +1, in fact, means having high values for all the other confusion matrix metrics. The same cannot be said for balanced accuracy, markedness, bookmaker informedness, accuracy and F1 score.},

	abstract = {The kinase TBK1 responds to microbial stimuli and mediates type I interferon (IFN-I) induction. We show that TBK1 is also a central mediator of growth factor signaling; this function relies on a specific adaptor, TBK-binding protein 1 (TBKBP1). TBKBP1 recruits TBK1 to PKCθ via a scaffold protein, Card10, which allows PKCθ to phosphorylate TBK1 at serine-716, a crucial step for TBK1 activation by growth factors but not by innate immune stimuli. While the TBK1/TBKBP1 signaling axis is dispensable for IFN-I induction, it mediates mTORC1 activation and oncogenesis. Lung epithelial cell-conditional deletion of either TBK1 or TBKBP1 inhibits tumorigenesis in a mouse model of lung cancer. In addition to promoting tumor growth, the TBK1/TBKBP1 axis facilitates tumor-mediated immunosuppression by a mechanism involving induction of the checkpoint molecule PD-L1 and stimulation of glycolysis. These findings suggest a PKCθ-TBKBP1-TBK1 growth factor signaling axis mediating both tumor growth and immunosuppression.},

	abstract = {Altered expressions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are potential cancer prognostic biomarkers that play a critical role in the development of tumorigenesis and metastasis of cancer. However, the relationship between the expression of lncRNAs in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and the diagnosis, progression, and prognosis of OSCC has not been thoroughly elucidated. To identify the differentially expressed lncRNAs between OSCC tissue and normal tissue, RNA-Seq data were used. lncRNA SLC16A1-AS1 was significantly highly expressed in OSCC samples than that in normal samples. Systematic bioinformatics analysis revealed that SLC16A1-AS1 was associated with histological tumor grades and overall survival status, as well as copy number variation, somatic mutation, tumor mutation burden, tumor stemness, tumor microenvironment and infiltrating immune cells. According to three advanced bioinformatic algorithms prediction (WGCNA, GSEA and GSVA), SLC16A1-AS1 played an essential role in OSCC proliferation and its biological function was related to cell-cycle regulation. Loss-of-function experiments were performed to determine the biological functions of SLC16A1-AS in OSCC cells. Silencing SLC16A1-AS1 significantly reduced the cell proliferation rate and colony-forming ability in both CAL27 and SCC25 cell lines. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis revealed that SLC16A1-AS1 silencing induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibited the expression of cyclin D1 in both CAL27 and SCC25 cells. In conclusion, our study comprehensively investigated the role of the lncRNA SLC16A1-AS1 in OSCC growth and proved that it may serve as a new diagnostic indicator and a new target for the treatment of OSCC.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy with high morbidity. The current study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of lncRNA SLC16A1-AS1 in the tumorigenesis of HCC.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The expression of SLC16A1-AS1 and miR-411 was examined in clinical HCC tissues. HCC cell lines Hep3B and Huh-7 were employed and transfected with si-SLC16A1-AS1. The correlation between SLC16A1-AS1 and miR-411 was verified by luciferase reporter assay. Cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay. Cell migration and invasion capacity were examined by transwell assay. The protein level of MITD1 was analyzed by western blotting.
RESULTS: The expression of SLC16A1-AS1 markedly increased in HCC tissues and cell lines. Subsequent studies identified SLC16A1-AS1 as a downstream target of miR-411. In addition, SLC16A1-AS1 knockdown and miR-411 overexpression significantly stagnated the progression of HCC cells. SLC16A1-AS1 knockdown also downregulated MITD1 levels.
CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that SLC16A1-AS1 was overexpressed in HCC cells and tissues. SLC16A1-AS1 promoted the malignant characteristics of HCC cells and acted as an oncogene. Its regulatory effect may be associated with miR-411/MITD1 axis. Therefore, SLC16A1-AS1 has the potential to be used as a biomarker or therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.},
